# QuoraQuestionPairs
A project I did for my Senior Seminar class. A program that checks whether a pair of questions asked on Quora is duplicate or not. In this project, I used data mining techniques to develope a program that processes and partitions the data set of 30,000 strings (questions) into a model that then returns the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure scores of the test. More of the overview and instructions can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data

For class instructions, we were to use Python 2.7.15 and the Jupyter Notebook IDE.
The program was made in Jupyter Notebook so when you view it you can also see the output (see the .ipynb file). 

This was my introduction into data science and big data!
