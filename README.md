# QuoraQuestionPairs
A project I did for my Senior Seminar class. A program that checks whether a pair of questions asked on Quora is duplicate or not. In this project I used data mining techniques to develope a program that processes and partitions the data set into a model that then returns the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure scores of the test.
